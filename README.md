Repository for UM6Ps Masters in Collective Intelligence Autumn 2023 class in Data Science, Programming, and Statistics I

**Before each class: **

Sync your machine with the repo, either in the VSCode GUI or by running

    git fetch
    
in the terminal

Checkout a branch with your name in the branch name by clicking '... -> Branch -> Checkout' in the 'Souce control' tab or running

    git checkout -b <newbranchname>
    
for the branch creation and

    git checkout  <branchname>
    
if you have created the branch before.

If you make any changes to any files, make sure to save as a new file that includes your name in the filename.

When you are ready to commit, you can stage the changes using the + symbol or running

    git add <filename_or_directory>

and you can commit the changes to the branch by writing a message (e.g. Ed Seabright Lab 1) and clicking 'commit' or by running

    git commit -am "commit message"


When you have commit changes to the repo on your branch initiate a pull request either on github directly (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or using the VSCode interface.
