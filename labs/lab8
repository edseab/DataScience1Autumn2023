## Welcome to lab #8. 

# Lets start by learning about p-hacking


# 1. THE ICE BATH STUDY
# In 2022 a paper was published in a medical journal that claimed to show 
# that taking ice-cold baths could have health benefits. They asssigned 50%
# of their subjects to the treatment group and received the ice baths
# and 50% to a control group that received no ice cold baths 
# (they could have received warm baths instead, but this study didn't do this)
# The paper abstract boasted that the ice baths had statistically significant (at the 5% level)
# effects on 3 health outcomes (perceived energy levels, mental alertness, probability of catching a cold within 1 week of treatment)
# Looking into the methods section of the paper, we can see that they actually 
# tested 60 different possible health outcomes (physical strength, skin health, blood pressure...)

# Could they have gotten these results purely by chance?

# Let's simulate the cold-water therapy experiment
# 1.1 Start by saving a sample size of 100 to an object N
N<-100
# 1.2 Next, create a vector of 1s and 0s, so that half of your sample receives the treatement (coded 1), and the other half doesn't (coded 0)
treatment <- c(rep(0, N/2), rep(1, N/2))

# Next we will run 60 different t-tests using a for loop, and save the p-value for each of these tests
# 1.3 start by initializing an empty vector for your p-values using an empty c() function. 
for(i in 1:60){
    y<-runif(N,60,150)
   test <- t.test(y[treatment==1], y[treatment==0])
   test$p.value-> p[i]
}

# 1.4 Next, write a for loop for a total of 60 loops
# For each loop, save a new y-variable that you have sampled completely at random
# your y-variable should be of length N, but otherwise you can sample it however you like (rnorm,runif,rbinom... any probability distribution you like with any parameter values you like)

# Next (still within the for loop), run a t-test comparing the y-values corresponding to treatment == 1 with the y-values corresponding to treatment ==0

# extract the p-value for that t-test and save it to the vector of p-values


# 1.5 After your for-loop is run, calculate the sum of the saved p-values that are less than 0.05

# 1.6 How many significant results are there at the 0.05 level?


# 1.7 Run the whole for loop again several times. How many significant results do you find each time?

# 1.8 Write a for loop that runs the previous for-loop multiple times, and save the number of significant results you get each time. Run this for loop at least 100 times


# 1.9 Plot the histogram of the number of significant results you get for each multiple comparisons experiment. What is the average number?


# 1.10 Run this whole code again, but this time increase the sample size N. Does your histogram look any different? why?

# 1.11 Run the code again, but this time instead of counting how many results are less than 0.05, divide this threshold by the total number of comparisons (60).



# 1.12 What does your new histogram look like?

# 1.13 This (dividing the p-value required for significance by the number of comparisons made) is called Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
# Why is it important?


# 2. Partitioned regression
data(mtcars)

# 2.1 Run a multiple regression using the mtcars database with fuel efficiency (mpg)
# as the dependent (outcome) variable and weight (wt) and number of cylinders (cyl)
# as independent (predictor) variables
# Look at the output of this regression and note the value of the parameter estimates for the effects of wt and cyl.
mlt_mod<- lm(mpg~wt + cyl, data=mtcars)
summary(mlt_mod)
# 2.2 save the residuals of the regression with formula (mpg ~ wt) into an object called mpg_wt_residuals
mpg_wt_residuals <- residuals(lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars))

# 2.3 Interpret this object. What does it represent?
#it is the differece between the prediction of mpgfrom the wt, and the actual observed fuel efficency
#It is what remains of the fuel efficiency, after the effect of wt has been accounted for

# 2.4 Save the residuals of the regression with formula (cyl ~ wt) into an object called cyl_wt_residuals
cyl_wt_residuals <- residuals(lm(cyl~wt, data=mtcars))
# 2.5 Interpret this object. What does it represent?

#The difference between the prodicted number of cylinders as a function of weight and the actual number of the cylinders

#It is what remains of the number of cylinders after the effect of weight has been accounted for

# 2.6 Run a regression with the formula (mpg_wt_residuals ~ cyl_wt_residuals)

lm(mpg_wt_residuals ~ cyl_wt_residuals, data=mtcars)
summary(lm(mpg_wt_residuals ~ cyl_wt_residuals, data=mtcars))
# 2.7 Based on your answers to 2.3 and 2.5, how do you interpret the slope estimate of the previous regression?

#It is the predicted effect  of the number of cylinder on the fuel efficiency after weight has been accounted for and the 

# 2.8 Compare this estimate to the estimate of wt in the original full model. 
# What do you conclude?

# 2.9 Use the same method to get the estimate of cyl from the original model using only simple linear regressions.

# 3.1 Load the dataset 'toycars' from the package 'DAAG'
install.packages('DAAG')

# This dataset contains information about experiments launching toy cars at different angles and measuring the distances they travel before falling to the ground.
# Learn more about this dataset by looking up ?toycars

# There are 3 different types of toy cars, numbered 1, 2, and 3

# We want to model the relationship between the type of car and the distance they travel. 
# 3.2 Which variable should be the outcome (dependent) variable? Why?
# Our outcome variable is the distance travelled by the cars,this is because the distance travelled can be easily measured.

# We want to see if the type of car will have an affect on the distance covered.

# 3.3 Run a regression model with the formula distance ~ car. How would you interpret the regression coefficient? What is the problem with this model? How would you rectify this problem?

# The intercept value of 0.68296 is the distance covered when there is no car.

# The slope indicates the change in distance travelled when we move from one car type to another is -0.04111 meters

# 3.4 Recode the 'car' variable so that car 1 is coded as 'green', car 2 is 'yellow', and car 3 is 'red'

  mutate(car = recode(car, '1' = 'green', '2' = 'yellow', '3' = 'red'))

# 3.5 Rerun the regression model using this recoded variable and interpret the coefficients. What does this model say about whether how choosing different cars affects the distances they travel?

new_model <-lm(distance~car, data=toycars)

# 3.6 Rerun the model again, this time including 'angle' as an independent variable. Interpret all 4 coefficients.
